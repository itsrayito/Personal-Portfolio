# Personal-Portfolio
## Description
For this week's challenge, we were assigned to create a personal portfolio that we will be using throughout the course and my career.
This week, I learned how to use HTML & CSS elements together by creating my very own personal portfolio where I will be able to showcase all of the work that I will be completing in this course.
## Features learned and used
- It is very necessary to make sure your website can adjust to smaller or larger screens in order for anyone using any sort of device to be able to view your website properly and can be well read.
-  I was able to better understand how Flexbox works in order to well put sections and text in websites by allowing responsive elements with a container to be automatically put depending on the screen size that it is being viewed from.
### The Process used
